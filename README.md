# OCFM
Simple command-line file manager for Linux and macOS written in Python 3.5.

# How do I use it?
The interface can be rather forbidding at first, I know. The commands are somewhat Vi-like:
:q or :quit or :exit - exit OCFM
:/ - return to the / directory
<Directory Name> - Move to specified directory
:delete - delete a file. Will ask for confirmation.
