# OCFM
Simple command-line file manager for Linux written in Python 3.5. Programmed on GalliumOS on my potato of a Chromebook.

# How do I use it?
The interface can be rather forbidding at first, like Vi. The commands are somewhat Vi-like: 
:q or :quit or :exit - exit OCFM.
:/ - return to the / directory.
<Directory Name> - Move to specified directory.
:delete - delete a file. Will ask for confirmation.
Type :h or :help at any time whilst using to view these commands again.

# What does OCFM require?
The OS Python module. A standard installation of Python 3.5 should cover this. Will require the Mousepad text editor and the VLC media player to function properly.

# Planned Features
Support for .txt, .md, .rtf, .wav, .mp4, .mp3, etc.

I also will at some point add a config file, and a first-time config. It will probably be in ~/.ocfm or something like that.
