# OCFM
Simple command-line file manager for Linux written in Python 3.5. Programmed on GalliumOS on my potato of a Chromebook.

# How do I use it?
The interface can be rather forbidding at first, like Vi. The commands are somewhat Vi-like:

:q or :quit or :exit - exit OCFM.

:/ - return to the / directory.

<Directory Name> - Move to specified directory.

:delete - delete a file. Will ask for confirmation.

:open <file> - open a file in nano. Only for text files.

Type :h or :help at any time whilst using to view these commands again.

# What does OCFM require?
The OS Python module. A standard installation of Python 3.5 should cover this. Also requires the Nano text editor.
